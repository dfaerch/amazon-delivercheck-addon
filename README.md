#Amazon delivery check Addon
This addon checks if Amazon delivers to your country, from the search page. Click the button when the result page is loaded: around each result a yellow border will appear.
The border will turn green when delivery is confirmed, turn red if delivery is impossible, and stay yellow if no information is available.
